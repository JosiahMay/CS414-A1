Incomplete Specifications:
None to my knowledge

Issues encountered:
The missing methods in the specifications in the workers and projects classes 
made designing the company class difficult at first. 

Since the specifications require the state of the object needed get methods,
there was an issues using for loops to unassign a worker from all projects.
To fix this issue, I make all the getter that returned a set return a shallow
copy of the set. This fix works for the current specifications but this will
not work if those sets are used for anything but checking values of items.


Challenges of the assignment:
Once I found what methods were missing from the assignment, it become much 
easier to finish coding.

The specifications require the state of the object to escape the oBject. This 
allows the state to be modified by any class and makes the project completely 
thread unsafe. I tried to protect the state but the specifications made this
impossible.
